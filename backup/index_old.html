									<!--Seasonal eddy-energetics in the Bay of Bengal--></a>
								<!-- <p> This study, which was conducted as part of my Ph.D. in Marine Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Science in China, looks at how swirling water currents, called eddies, move heat and salt around in the Bay of Bengal (BOB). 
									We found that these eddies are very active in four specific areas: the northern BOB near its western boundary, the western BOB, 
									the southwestern BOB near Sri Lanka, and the southeastern BOB. In the northern and southwestern BOB, these eddies mainly move heat 
									during the pre-summer months (March to April) and the summer monsoon season (May to September). In the western and southeastern BOB, 
									the main activity happens during the post-summer monsoon season (October to November). Because the Bay of Bengal is partially 
									enclosed, these eddies don't just move heat and salt north and south but also east and west. This is important because it changes how 
									heat is distributed in the bay. We also found that the energy driving these eddies comes mainly from a process called baroclinic 
									instability in most regions, which happens when there's a difference in water density layers. In the southeastern BOB, another process 
									called barotropic instability, which involves the flow speed of water layers, is also important. Using a special model called 2.5-layer 
									reduced gravity model, we further studied this baroclinic instability and discovered that strong changes in water flow speed and weak water layering are key to 
									creating these energetic eddies. This understanding helps explain why and when these eddies are most active in moving heat around 
									in different parts of the Bay of Bengal.
								</p> -->
								<p>Investigated the role of mesoscale eddies in redistributing heat and salt across the Bay of Bengal (BOB), a critical region for monsoon dynamics and
								climate variability. Using satellite altimetry data (<a href="https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/description">SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047</a>), in situ measurements from <a href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/argo/">Argo floats</a>, and <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3459130"> CTD casts</a>, 
								remotely sensed wind data from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (<a href="https://www.remss.com/measurements/ccmp/">CCMP</a>) product, climatological data from the NOAA NCEP World Ocean Atlas<a href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/"> (WOA)</a>, and eddy-resolving ocean circulation data from the Ocean General Circulation Model For the Earth 
								Simulator (<a href="https://www.jamstec.go.jp/ofes/">OFES</a>), 
								we quantified turbulent transport mechanisms and identified key subregions—western boundary currents, Sri Lanka’s southwestern coast, and the southeastern BOB—where eddy activity peaks seasonally.</p>
								<p>
								<b>Key Findings:</b>
								<ul>
									<li align="justify">Identified distinct seasonal hotspots: mesoscale eddies are highly active in four subregions of the BOB, with distinct seasonal patterns, pre-summer monsoon (March–April) in the northern BOB, summer monsoon (May–September) near Sri Lanka, and post-summer monsoon (October–November) in the western and southeastern BOB.</li>
									<!-- <li align="left">Heat transport is most significant in the northern and southwestern BOB during pre-summer and summer monsoon seasons.</li> -->
									<!-- <li align="left">In the western and southeastern BOB, eddy activity peaks during the post-summer monsoon season.</li> -->
									<li align="justify">Demonstrated that zonal transport is as significant as meridional transport due to the BOB’s semienclosed geometry, challenging traditional poleward-centric models.</li>
									<li align="justify">Validated depth confinement of eddy-induced heat transport: heat anomalies within 400 m and salt anomalies within 200 m, using Argo-derived climatologies.</li>
									<li align="justify">Baroclinic instability is the primary driver of eddy energy, with barotropic instability also playing a role in the southeastern BOB (— Mechanisms and their regional influences).</li>

									<!-- <p>This study, which was another result of my Ph.D., looks at how the movement of heat by swirling water currents, called eddies, changes from year to year in the western part of the South China Sea 
										during the summer. We used a method to measure how these eddies mix heat and explored why these changes happen. Our findings show that the most significant 
										heat movement by eddies in the South China Sea happens in the western region during the summer. We noticed that in some years, such as 1994, 1999, 2002, 2006,
										2008, 2009, 2012, and 2014, there was a lot of heat movement and high energy in the water. In other years, like 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2015, 
										and 2017, there was much less of this activity during the months of July, August, and September. By examining data along a specific longitude (110.75° E), 
										we discovered that in the years with strong heat movement, there was an intefication of the eastward current at the surface of the water that helps to create 
										more energetic eddies through a process called baroclinic instability, which occurs due to differences in water layer speeds. The changes in these water layer 
										speeds are linked to differences in temperature across the region, which are influenced by several factors. These include the movement of water due to wind, 
										the flow of water across different latitudes, and the way heat is absorbed at the surface. Additionally, we found that local wind patterns and forces from 
										distant regions that are associated with large scale climate modes such as the El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affect these year-to-year changes in 
										heat movement by eddies in the South China Sea.</p> -->
									<p>
										Investigated the mechanisms driving year-to-year changes in summertime eddy heat transport (EHT) in the western South China Sea (WSCS),
										combining satellite altimetry data (<a href="https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/description">SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047</a>),

										climatological data from the NOAA NCEP World Ocean Atlas<a href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/"> (WOA)</a>,
										ocean reanalysis (SODAv3/GODAS), eddy-resolving ocean circulation data from the Ocean General Circulation Model For the Earth Simulator (<a href="https://www.jamstec.go.jp/ofes/">OFES</a>), and linear stability modeling.
										Key findings reveal how monsoon-driven currents and large-scale climate patterns modulate heat redistribution via mesoscale eddies in the SCS.

									<p>In this study, we developed a new parameter called the Lagoon Richardson Number (RiL) to better understand how water layers mix in permanently open coastal 
									   lagoons in Sri Lanka. This new measurement is based on an existing one used for estuaries (RiE), but we made it more suitable for these specific lagoons by 
									   including not only the effect of tides but also wind on water mixing. We also updated an existing model by replacing its old measurement (RiE) 
									   with our new one (RiL) to make it more accurate for these types of lagoons. Using RiL, we found that during the dry season, there's a significant reduction in the
	                                   energy needed to mix the water, making wind-induced mixing more noticeable compared to the rainy season. <!--This was particularly evident in the Koggala Lagoon.-->										
								       When we applied our updated model to the Koggala Lagoon, it proved to be better at predicting salinity mixing status, especially during the dry season,
